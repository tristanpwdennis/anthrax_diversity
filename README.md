# anthrax_diversity
Assorted scripts and data from Forde et al, 2020

The anthraxanalysis script will generate figures XX, XX XX from the data contained in the data directory in the figures directory. The directory also contains the final, edited figure versions that I edited manually in Illustrator.

Also contained in the data directory are - the supplementary data (as a .csv) and the final vcf used to generate the phylogeny and distance matrix.
